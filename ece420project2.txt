Powerflow transmission line analysis:

The transmission line between 20307 Mcnary and 20435 Sacjaw carries a lot of the load to the 500KV buses. It is laoded with a 78.7% of its rated MVA in normal conditions. This represents a weaknees point in the system because there is a wide range of contingencies that could occur and over load this line. Another possible problem represented by this line is that if there was an unexpted outage on the line then the whole system would get floded with the power that's being transfered on this line because it's a huge amount of power that will have to be re-routed. 
Another line on the 500KV side that represents possible weaknesses is the line between 20435 Sacjwa and 20226 Low Mon. It is also at 62% of it's rated MVA in normal conditions and could easily get over loaded.
On the 320KV side, the transmission line between 20530 Wallula and 20529 Wala Wala is at 62% rated MVA. That could possibly be a weak spot for the same reasons above. Also, the chain of busses between Mcnary and Wala wala are all supplying big loads. Any outage on one of these lines could overload the 500KV side of the system.
